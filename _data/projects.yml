    In this paper, we investigate the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing Text-to-SQL performance by benchmarking their efficacy, proposing novel similarity metrics for SQL queries, and demonstrating their applicability in financial domain use cases, thereby facilitating the automation of natural language interaction with relational databases and advancing the practical adoption of Text2SQL systems.

    In this paper, we propose a method for improving machine translation accuracy in low-resource language environments by utilizing knowledge distillation from large multilingual models and incorporating high-resource languages related to the target language, exemplified through the evaluation on Luxembourgish, demonstrating over 30% faster performance with only a 4% decrease in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models.
